# cool-free-wallpaper

Having discovered that classic oil paintings (specifically Claude Monet, Impressionist style) make the best desktop wallpapers I faced 3 challenges:

1) Where to find high quality images of existing oil paintings
2) How to automate the downloads (I like to have constantly rotating wallpapers, so need many downloaded)
3) Which images to download given these are for wallpapers (aspect ratio sensitive)

Luckily the [The Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection API](https://metmuseum.github.io/) allows for this.

## Usage

### WORK IN PROGRESS

For now modify code to specify the max amount of images to download, the aspect ratio upper and lower bounds, and the parameters for the images.

The last is most important as obviously you can only view the images once they are downloaded.

By going [here](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search?) you can see what images result from given parameters, and then use those same paramters.
